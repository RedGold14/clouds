Benefits of cloud computing:
- Cost. Cloud computing eliminates the CapEx of buying hardware and software and seting up and running on-site datacenters.
- Speed. Vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks.
- Global scale. Delivering the right amount of IT resources. 
- Productivity. Cloud computing removes the need of hardware and software setup, other IT management chores. 
- Performance. Datacenters are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and and efficient computing hardware.
- Reliability. Data backup, disaster recovery. Data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites.
- Security. Broad set of policies, technologies and contols.

Three different ways to deploy cloud services: public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud. 

Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providees, which deliver their computing resources. 

Private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. Can be physically located on the company's on site datacenter. Services and infrastructure maintained on a private network.

Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.

Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless, and SaaS

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
Platform as a service (PaaS) 
Software as a service (SaaS)

IaaS - Servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems.
PaaS - On-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications.
SaaS - Delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis.

Serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure to do so. Highly scalable and event-driven.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Public clouds can be deployed faster that on-premises infrastructures and with almost infinitely scalable platform.

Private clouds deliver a higher level of security and privacy through both company firewalls and internal hosting to ensure operations and sensitive data are not accessible to third-party providers.

Two models can be delivered in a private cloud - IaaS, PaaS.

Public cloud:
- No CapEx to scale up 
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
- Organizations pay only for what they use 

Private cloud:
- Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance 
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates 

Hybrid cloud:
- Provides the most flexibility 
- Organizations determine where to run their applications
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

Disaster recovery - How quickly can you get your computers and systems up and running after disastrous event. The cost savings of having a disaster recovery plan are enormous.

High availability is the concept or goal of ensuring your critical systems are always functioning. High availability is a strategy.

Fault tolerance describes a computer system or technology infrastructure that is designed in such a way that when one component fails, a backup component takes over operations immediately so that there is no loss of service.
